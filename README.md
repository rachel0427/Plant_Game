# Plants of Wrath
This is a game in which plants get mad over their position, and need to be
fed Vodka, so they don't explode with rage.

## How to Play
In this game, you are accepting a challenge from the kind and generous BIG GRANDPA.
Your goal is to earn 500 from buying and selling plants within 8 rounds. 

Since plants all love a good amount of sun and fresh air, they are happier on a 
higher level and angrier on a lower level.

Therefore, you need to strategically place and move your plants on the shelf to keep
them from exploding with anger.
