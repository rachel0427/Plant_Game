Initialization:
1. shelves all empty
2. plants all happy, angry level = 0 -> need to be watered in x rounds

Round 1
1. Initialize shelves to be all empty, then put two level 1(good) plants on middle(???) shelf
2. Two good plants are happy and need to be watered in 2 rounds
3. Money = 50(??)

Anger Logic:
Note: there are 3 mood levels in total, 0 - 2, and when anger rises above that range, plants explode
1. Anger Level Rise by 1 when: 任意一个发生， 还是叠加？
    1. vodka not applied when anger level > 0
    2. plant is moved down one shelf
    3. leek arrives
2. Anger Level Drop by 1 when:
    1. vodka applied when anger level > 0
    2. plant is moved up one shelf
    3. leek removed???

Explode Logic: plant only explode when anger level >= 3
# FIXME: does exploded plant destroy other plants?

vodka bottle class -> input list of plant

1. 怎么拖动，距离怎么算
2. while loop外面写plant array

Variable Mapping:
anger_state: 0 -- happy; 1 -- okay; 2 -- upset; 3 -- furious
shelf_pos: 0 -- top shelf; 1 -- middle shelf; 2 -- bottom shelf

Anger System:
1. Placed on shelf - initialize anger state (top - happy, middle - sad, bottom - angry)
2. Move up/down within round, just add or minus, use cur/prev would be better
3. next round, if still in top shelf, anger level - 1;
                  still in middle shelf, anger_level don't change;
                  still in bottom shelf, anger_level + 1
